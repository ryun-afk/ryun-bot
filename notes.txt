Use breakpoint and debugger to see variable data without printing


# location[::-1] reverses list: [y],[x] -> [x],[y]
# *location[] unpacks lists
# zip(location[]) merges lists with same index
#
# [[y1,y2,...],[x1,x2,...]] --> [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],[...,...]] format
locations = list(zip(*locations[::-1]))

HSV versus RGB
RBG is an additive method to represent colors
more red, green, or clue, makes the color brighter

HSV uses hue, saturation, and value tp represent colors
    Hue - angle of color on RGB circle
    Saturation - amount of color used
    Value - brightness of color
helpul for isolating and detecting colors in a spectrum.
    

keypoint_image = keypoint_image[y:y+h, x:x+w]
[a:b,c:d] similar to excel for selecting parts of an image
